    <!-- CHART ONE -->
    <h1> How does the tech industry see itself when it comes to diversity? </h1>
    <p style='text-align:center'>-</p>
    <p class='intro'> <img src='images/womentech.png' />It is no secret that gender diversity in the technology industry is a problem. The workforce is dominated by males, women underrepresented. As women in tech, we wanted to look at just how large of a problem the role of women in the industry is, and also at insiders' opinions of the problem. <i>Is it as big of a problem as we hear it is? How does representation change as women move through different roles? </i> Furthermore, we wanted to look at how men and women view the problem differently, and what how the causes people posit differ between genders. </p>
    <p class='intro'> The following visual essay presents recent findings (within the past two years) about gender diversity in the tech industry, but we acknowledge that these distinctions are broad categories that not everyone may identify with. We hope that by exploring these visualizations, you can consider your own perceptions of tech's diversity problem as it is today.</p>
    <h2 style='font-family: Consolas, monaco, monospace'> Women in technical roles </h2>
    <p style='width: 650px'> Toggle the slider below to guess how many technical roles are held by women. </p>
    <div class="vis1"></div>
    <p class='explain'> In a Bloomberg report that surveyed 1,400 tech employees, 94% of American tech workers gave the industry and their company culture 'a passing grade' on diversity (about a C). </p>
    <p class='explain'> However, only 24% of women occupy technical jobs (e.g., software engineering, product management, data analysis) - much lower than what is normally considered a 'passing grade.' It's even worse for black and latinx folks, who only make up 5% of the workforce. This report proves the perceptual dissonance of diversity within the industry. </p>

    <!-- CHART TWO -->
    <h2 style='font-family: Consolas, monaco, monospace'>Women at Each Level in Tech</h2>
    <p style="width: 600px">Click through the corporate levels, and see how the proportion of women in those roles changes.</p>
    <br />
    <div class="vis2"></div>
    <p class='explain'>While women are clearly not employed in the tech industry at the same rate as men, once
    they are in, they still face difficulties advancing up the corporate ladder, and continue to fall behind.
     Especially between at the level Vice President and above, there is a drop in the number of Women
     holding leadership positions in the tech industry.</p>

     <p class='explain'> Since the executives at the highest level of the company
     generally reach that position by working their way up the ladder, the lack of representation at each level
     reduces the chance of women reaching the top of corprate leadership. At the highest corporate level, the C-Suite, women make up only
     17% of employees.</p>

    <!-- CHART THREE -->
    <h2 style='font-family: Consolas, monaco, monospace'>Who Thinks it's a Problem</h2>
    <p style="width: 600px">How big of a problem do you think discrimination against women in tech is? Use the checkboxes to compare your response to those of US adults.</p>
    <br />
    <div class="vis3"></div>
    <br />
    <p class='explain'>Among US adults, there is a clear divide among who thinks that diversity
       in tech is a problem, and who doesn't. Across genders, about 73% of adults think discrimination
       against women in the tech industry is some sort of problem. But when splitting the population by
       gender, there is a clear difference between men and women. 14% more women think that discrimination
       is a problem. In addition, the number of women who think diversity in tech is a
      major problem is larger than those who think it is a minor problem.
      This order is reversed among men: of men who think diversity is a problem in tech, more think
      it is only a minor one, rather than a major one.</p>

    <p class='explain'> "First Round Capital," a venture capital firm that specializes in funding tech companies, publishes the results of an annual survey taken by the nation's top tech start-up founders. Some questions on the survey ask about the current representation of women and/or ehtnic minorities in the industry at large.</p>
    <p class='explain'>In this report, men are 4x more likely to cite a pipeline problem than to cite unconscious bias in hiring or promotions. Women, on the other hand, disagree. The few women founders that were surveyed clearly consider unconscious bias to play the biggest role in the diversity gap.</p>
    <p style='text-align:center'>-</p>
    <p class='intro'>
      There is no denying that women are a minority in the tech industry. They make up significantly less of the total employees than men, and even once they enter the industry, they advance less than men, and the representation decreases further up the corporate pipeline.
      In order to make meaningful change, people first have to recognize that diversity is a problem. However, this is easier said than done. Less men than women think diversity is a problem, and of those that do, less think it is a major problem.
      It is also important to identify the causes of the diversity problem. Again, this is an area in which men and women disagree. They attribute tech's diversity problem to different causes, and in different proportions. It is clear the divide in the industry goes beyond just the number of workers. The divide extends to opinions about the problem itself.
    </p>
    <p class='intro'>It is also important to rememeber that there is not just a gender diversity problem in tech, but also an ethnic diversity problem. The industry is dominated by white males. Blacks and Latinos make up only 5% of the workforce<sup>1</sup>, independent of gender.
      88% of blacks, and 86% of Hispanics say that discrimination is a problem in tech, compared to only 60% of whites<sup>3</sup>. The diversity problem, and people's view of it, is not restricted to gender.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">Is there hope for diversity in technology? We would like to believe so. There is a push for increased awareness of the diversity problem, with more studies coming out, which provide reccomendations to companies for fixing their diversity problem.
    Many companies, both large and small, are making committments to diversity, and to improved and transparent hiring practices. We also hope that this essay allowed you to reflect on your own opinion about the diversity problem, and how you may have implicit assumptions or biases.
    The first step to making a change is understanding and acknowledging the problem, and if everyone working in the tech industry can continue to do this, there is hope for the diversity problem to improve, both for women and for minorities.
